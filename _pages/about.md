Hi! My name is Molin Zhang and Iâ€™m a rising fifth-year PhD student at Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at MIT working with Prof. Elfar Adalsteinsson.
My research centers on the intersection of computational imaging, computer vision, and signal processing, with a particular emphasis on medical imaging. I delve into the realm of inverse problems, utilizing numerical simulations to develop innovative solutions. 


Feel free to reach me at **molin [at] mit [dot] edu**.

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.test

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
